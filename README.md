# Ascension-Game-Master-Glossary (Overview)
A master glossary for the card game, Ascension. Includes mechanics from all expansions. As a new player, I felt it would be helpful to have a text-searchable master glossary, but I struggled to find such a resource, and was left sorting through multiple expansion rule books (this is especially difficult if you jump into the app with multiple expansions already unlocked). I've made an attempt at creating a master glossary myself, to help myself learn the game, and to hopefully help others. Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions!

# Notes, and Future Improvements
- Some of the definitions were taken as-is from official rule books (https://www.stoneblade.com/rules). I do not take credit for many of these definitions.
- Some of the mechanics defined in this glossary are only applicable if particular game expansions are in play.
  - TODO: Indicate for which expansion a particular glossary term relates, if it is only applicable to a single or set of expansions.
- TODO: Add meaningful descriptions for each game expansion definition below.
