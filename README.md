# Ascension-Game-Master-Glossary (Overview)
A master glossary for the card game, Ascension. Includes mechanics from all expansions. As a new player, I felt it would be helpful to have a text-searchable master glossary, but I struggled to find such a resource, and was left sorting through multiple expansion rule books. I've made an attempt at creating a master glossary, to help myself learn the game, and to hopefully help others. Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions!

# Notes
- Some of the definitions were taken as-is from official rule books (https://www.stoneblade.com/rules).
- Some mechanics are only applicable if particular game expansions are in play. Required expansions are noted in square-brackets.
